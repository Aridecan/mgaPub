# Creative Brief — Prologue / Tutorial

## Overview

The prologue serves as the tutorial and the opening of Meghan's story on Terridyn. It introduces stealth, traversal, combat, and the economy — and does all of it through fiction rather than interrupting the game to explain mechanics. By the end of the prologue the player has a place to sleep, a reason to go to school, and two people they've met organically.

## Story Beats

### Arrival

Meghan arrives at Terridyn's surface port at **1:30 AM on a Sunday**. Her shuttle was delayed by a mechanical problem coming down from the anchor station; everyone else on the manifest took hotel rooms and rebooked for morning. The shuttle is empty. The port is quiet.

At customs, she discovers that her Calibran passport has been upgraded — without her knowledge or consent — to a diplomatic passport, listing her as a Cultural Ambassador. Calibran has no diplomatic relations with Terridyn, but the passport carries weight regardless. The customs agent, unsure how to handle an unscheduled diplomatic arrival at this hour, steps away to wake his supervisor.

Meghan is shown to the VIP lounge to wait.

She doesn't wait.

Leaving her luggage and passport behind, she slips out of the lounge and tries to reach the city before anyone can formalise whatever the Calibran government has decided she is.

### Tutorial Zone — The Port

**Stealth segment:** The port's camera system is the first obstacle. [S.T.A.L.K.E.R.](../gdd/game-systems.md) monitors everything, but customs enforcement is slow at 3am. Meghan has to navigate the port's camera coverage to reach the luggage terminal without being flagged.

This segment introduces the stealth system and C.A.M.E.R.A.'s two modes — laser line-of-sight for full third-person view, radio fallback for close proximity awareness.

**Luggage terminal — DLC branch:**

At the luggage terminal, Meghan has to find a way out. The route depends on what content is installed:

| Version | Route | Mechanics introduced |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Base | Over the beams above the luggage claim area | Jumping puzzle / traversal tutorial |
| Spicy | Through the maintenance air vents — joints are badly maintained and may not survive the trip | Trap tutorial, clothing destruction system |
| Super Spicy | Branches from Spicy — a wrong turn lands her in the impound room before she finds the exit | Adult content, additional scene |

The base route is the cleanest path. The Spicy route is harder and carries economic consequences if clothing is destroyed. The Super Spicy route extends from that branch.

### The City

Meghan reaches the air tram and rides into downtown Terridyn City. Everything is closed. The city is half-empty on a good day; at this hour it is a ghost town.

She hears something — and finds Celeste Burton being assaulted by gang members in the **alley behind Burton's Tavern**, where she had been taking out the night's refuse. Burton's Tavern closes at 2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays; Celeste is doing end-of-night cleanup in the back alley when the gang arrives. Meghan is the only person around.

**Combat tutorial:** The fight introduces the combat system, consciousness points, and the nanotech shield feedback mechanic.

### After the Fight

Celeste and Meghan talk. Meghan has no place to stay, no luggage, and no clear plan beyond "get to Terridyn and figure it out." Celeste, running a six-bedroom dorm apartment with two other occupants, offers her a room until she gets settled.

Meghan meets Terry back at the dorm. Terry and Celeste are enrolled at the local tertiary school. Meghan mentions she was hoping to apply. The connection is made.

The prologue ends with Meghan having a bed, two people who don't know anything about who she was, and a reason to sit the entrance exams.

## Design Notes

- The empty shuttle is a practical decision — no need for a populated passenger manifest
- The passport situation is introduced here but not resolved; it is a long thread
- Celeste meeting Meghan is entirely organic — no external arrangement
- All three tutorial segments (stealth, traversal, combat) arise from the fiction; none are signposted as tutorials
- The DLC branch uses the same location and moment — the content tier shapes the experience without breaking the structure
