# MGA — Title and Branding

---

## Title Rationale

The full title is **Ordinary Girl Meghan / Magical Girl Ava**.

The dual name was chosen for several reinforcing reasons:

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structural honesty** | Chapter 1 is 10+ hours of Meghan content — introduction to Terridyn, the job system, school, bounty hunting, combat, and the main cast. The title character Magical Girl Ava does not appear until the end-of-chapter mission. A title that leads with "Magical Girl Ava" alone would mislead players about what the first act contains. |
| **Transformation story** | The game is not about being a magical girl — it is about *becoming* one. The dual name communicates this arc up front: ordinary first, magical second. |
| **Identity duality** | Meghan and Ava are not quite the same person. Ava is the empowered identity born from Meghan's trauma, survival, and growth. The dual name telegraphs this psychological split from the title screen. |
| **Genre differentiation** | Most magical girl titles lead with the magical identity (Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Puella Magi Madoka Magica). MGA leads with the ordinary identity, signalling that this is a story about the transition rather than the destination. |
| **Marketing clarity** | Players who see "Magical Girl Ava" and then spend 10 hours as Meghan may feel confused or misled. The dual title sets correct expectations and invites curiosity about when and how the transformation occurs. |

## Fraction Logo

The title is styled as a **fraction** — "Ordinary Girl Meghan" on top, "Magical Girl Ava" on the bottom, with Ava's name serving as the dividing line.

```
  Ordinary Girl Meghan
 ═══════════════════════
   Magical Girl Ava
```

### Symbolic meaning

- **Ava is the division in Meghan's heart.** The divider represents the wound, the fracture, the transformation that splits Meghan's life into "before" and "after."
- **The Seventh Circle connection.** Ava's freezing of the 7th Circle of Hell is the exact moment Meghan becomes divided from herself. The logo encodes this as foreshadowing.
- **Numerator and denominator.** Meghan (the grounded, ordinary life) sits above; Ava (the magical power she becomes) sits below. Ava divides and defines Meghan.

### Visual treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **"Ordinary Girl Meghan"** | Simple, bold typography; grounded, warm tones |
| **Divider line** | Frozen ice with a black crack running through it — referencing the Seventh Circle freeze |
| **"Magical Girl Ava"** | Subtly illuminated; faint magical glow; sharper or more stylised typeface |

The contrast between the two text treatments makes the logo immediately readable and reinforces the identity split at a glance.

## Title Screen Art — "Shadow of Ava"

The main title screen uses a single composition with four visual zones:

### Layout

| Quadrant | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Top-left** | Fraction logo |
| **Bottom-left** | Meghan and Ava's shadow |
| **Top-right** | Main menu (acting as the streetlight) |
| **Bottom-right** | Negative space / soft light falloff |

### Composition

- **Background:** Black or near-black.
- **Meghan** stands slightly left of centre in one of her bounty-hunting outfits (pants or shorts, sneakers or calf-high boots, leather jacket). She is the only full-colour element, lit from the front by an implied streetlamp.
- **Behind her**, where her shadow would fall, stands the **silhouette of Ava** — same pose, but with distinct differences visible only in silhouette: skirt, knee-high boots, armour on left leg and arm, hair ornaments, and wand strapped horizontally to the back of her belt.
- **The streetlamp itself is not visible** — only its effect. A circular light pool anchors Meghan in space.
- **The main menu** sits in the top-right where the streetlamp would logically be, using the same warm white/yellow light colour as the lamp glow — creating **diegetic UI** that feels grounded in the scene rather than pasted on top.

### Mood

Lonely, mysterious, transformative, slightly melancholy. A quiet moment before the storm. The title screen suggests Meghan is on the cusp of discovering something enormous — without revealing what.

### Animation (subtle, optional)

1. Screen starts nearly black
2. Streetlight faintly clicks on
3. Meghan fades in under the glow
4. Ava's silhouette emerges from the darkness behind her
5. Logo fades in
6. Menu appears last, flickering slightly like an old streetlamp

Total time: 3–6 seconds. Subtle, not flashy.

## Evolving Title Screen

The title screen composition **changes across the game** to mirror Meghan and Ava's psychological arc. Players may not consciously notice the shifts on a first playthrough — the changes are designed to be felt, not announced.

| Chapter | Composition | Symbolism |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ch.1** | Meghan in the light; Ava is the shadow | Ordinary world; hidden magical identity |
| **Ch.2** | Ava's shadow grows larger and sharper; Meghan's light dims slightly | Ava's presence strengthening |
| **Ch.3** | **Ava takes the foreground** — full-colour, lit. Meghan becomes the shadow | Identity inversion during Machina Dynamics moral descent; Meghan loses herself to Ava |
| **Ch.4** | Meghan and Ava stand side-by-side; lighting equalises; shadows balance | Multiplication / synergy — they empower each other |
| **Ch.5** | Shared light; merged silhouette behind them; logo colours balance | Addition / bonding |
| **Ch.6** | Ava vanishes; Meghan lit alone; shadow broken into shards | Subtraction / loss |

The logo subtly evolves alongside the composition — "Ordinary Girl Meghan" and "Magical Girl Ava" shift in brightness, saturation, and crack spread to match the emotional state of each chapter.

## Chapter Title Operator System

Chapter titles use **mathematical operators** between Meghan and Ava's names to encode their identity arc. The system is deliberately subtle — designed to reward attentive replay rather than announce itself.

| Operator | Meaning | Emotional state | Example usage |
|----------|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| ÷ | Division, fracture, wound | Trauma, separation | Early chapters — the identities are split |
| × | Multiplication, synergy | Empowerment, teamwork | Ch.4 — "Meghan × Ava"; first true identity fusion |
| + | Addition, bonding | Emotional healing | Cooperation and shared purpose |
| − | Subtraction, loss | Sacrifice, separation | A painful moment where the magical identity is taken or severed |
| = | Identity resolution | Unity | "Meghan = Ava" — they are one person |
| ∞ | Transcendence | Final form / destiny | Complete acceptance of both selves; limitless |

The progression from ÷ to ∞ traces Meghan's full psychological journey from fractured trauma survivor to unified, transcendent identity.

**Design intent:** Brevity is the soul of wit. Players will not notice the operator system on a first playthrough — and possibly not on a second. When they do notice, the entire arc clicks into place retroactively.

## NG+ Title Screen — Tierney Embracing Ava

The NG+ title screen replaces the Shadow of Ava composition with an image of **Tierney hugging Ava from behind** — both arms and wings wrapped protectively around her, chin resting against Ava's back or shoulder.

This image is **too spoilery for the main game** — it reveals Tierney's true nature, her emotional investment in Ava, and the depth of their relationship. It belongs exclusively in NG+, where the player already understands:

- Tierney's true identity and role in Meghan's life
- The Seventh Circle connection
- The centuries of guilt Tierney carries
- The full arc from manipulation to genuine love

### Emotional reframing through NG+ narrative

NG+ is the story of Tierney's AI (synced to her memory before the space elevator ride) trying to determine what happened to Tierney at the end of Chapter 6 — and both Meghan and the AI coming to terms with Tierney's apparent death.

In this context, the embrace becomes **a memory that never happened** — an idealised moment the AI reconstructs from emotional data, knowing Tierney cared for Ava even if she never expressed it openly. It is simultaneously:

- Forgiveness and acceptance
- A reconstruction of love from incomplete data
- A lost timeline — what should have been
- A grief made gentle

### Visual treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Lighting** | Warm golden light — contrasting the cold streetlamp tones of the main game |
| **Background** | Soft gradient or ethereal glow (twilight/dawn), not the oppressive black of the main screens |
| **Tierney** | Wings wrapped protectively; expression soft, vulnerable, relieved |
| **Ava** | Calm, perhaps slightly surprised or leaning into the embrace; not in combat stance |
| **Logo** | Final-form operator — "Meghan = Ava" or "Meghan∞Ava" |

The tonal shift from cold/dark/lonely (main game) to warm/soft/connected (NG+) tells the player visually: *you are not the same player anymore, and this is not the same story.*
