## The Setting

Three hundred years from now, the colony planet Terridyn should be thriving. It isn't.

The Terridyn Flu swept through the population over a century ago. The Exodus — the mass evacuation of survivors — left infrastructure standing and people gone. Cities built for millions now hold tens of thousands. The planet is repopulating slowly, and into that vacuum came the corporations.

Terridyn is not a member of the Alliance, the political body governing most of human space. The Alliance's reach doesn't extend here, which means the megacorporations that moved in answer to no one but each other and whatever can be extracted from a world still half-empty. The biggest players are the Big 20 — the top twenty corporations operating in cities that are mostly ghost towns wearing a functional face.

Underneath the corporate surface: a black market, a trafficking pipeline, and older powers that predate the Exodus and are not human.

## The Protagonist

Meghan was a magical girl. Was. She retired. She broke her wand. She left.

She arrived on Terridyn to do something ordinary: pass the MCI entrance examination, study, work, build something quiet. The planet is far from where she came from. The people who knew who she was don't know where she is. That was the plan.

The world has other plans.

## The Premise

MGA opens with Meghan's arrival and her first attempt to hold an ordinary life together: rent due, exams to pass, debt to pay off, a city to navigate. Everything she learns doing that — the skills she builds waiting tables, delivering packages, hacking corporate terminals, taking bounties — turns out to be exactly what she needs when the city stops letting her stay ordinary.

One person. One skill system. The same Meghan who learns to navigate a crowded bar floor is the same Meghan who climbs a corporate security tower. The game does not split them.

The story runs for six chapters, each escalating the scale of what she is up against: from street-level trouble, through hell-contaminated mana events and corporate conflict, to something older and larger that has been operating in the background since before she arrived. By the end of Chapter 6, everything Meghan built during her attempt to be ordinary becomes the thing she needed all along.

## Tone

MGA is a story-heavy action RPG with an urban fantasy spine. It is not a power fantasy — Meghan starts with nothing and earns everything she has. It is not grimdark — the world is difficult but warmth is possible, and the relationships Meghan builds are worth caring about. It is explicitly adult in its subject matter: adult themes are treated seriously, and the content tier system ensures players can engage with as much or as little of that as they choose.

The game is action-biased. It moves, it has momentum, the fights matter. It is not a souls-like; difficulty is present and meaningful, and friction controls ensure that access to content is not gated by reflex for players who don't want it to be.

Comedic moments exist and land because the world earns them. The cast has personality. Nobody is a cardboard archetype.

## The Cast

**Meghan** — The player character. A former magical girl trying to be ordinary. Her history emerges through the game; the opening does not front-load her backstory. What she carries with her is visible in how she acts, what she deflects, and what she can't quite leave behind.

**Terry** — Meghan's roommate. Warm, present, domestically capable, and disarmingly easy to talk to. Makes the apartment feel like a home. Seems completely ordinary. Knows the city unusually well.

**Celeste Burton** — Meghan meets Celeste organically before anyone arranges it. Celeste works at Burton's Bar, run by her family, and becomes a friend quickly and genuinely. She is not a plot device; she is a person the game asks the player to care about.

**Milo** — Meghan's familiar. Their relationship has history that the player gradually uncovers. Milo is protective, sometimes to a fault, and is carrying something she hasn't fully told Meghan yet.

**Elisa** — Personal assistant to the CEO of Machina Dynamics. Professional, precise, and quietly intimidating. Not entirely what she appears.

## The Chapter Structure

Chapters are task-complete, not timer-complete — they continue until story objectives are finished. Some quests within chapters are time-limited; the chapter itself does not expire.

| Chapter | Scale of conflict |
|---------|------------------|
| **Prologue** | Arrival; orientation; Meghan meets the city |
| **Chapter 1** | Street-level; gang activity; first crisis; first test |
| **Chapter 2** | City-scale; hell seal contamination; corporate interest begins |
| **Chapter 3** | Corporate; Meghan's new workplace has its own agenda |
| **Chapter 4** | Multi-corporate; the team takes shape; stakes broaden |
| **Chapter 5** | Institutional; a major corporation makes its full move |
| **Chapter 6** | Everything converges; civilian skills become the primary tools |
