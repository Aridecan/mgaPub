# MGA — Core Loop

---

## The Fantasy

The player is Meghan: a person trying to hold an ordinary life together in a city that keeps making that harder. She has rent due, exams to pass, debt to pay off, and a growing sense that the world around her is not what it appears. The fantasy is competence under pressure — building capability through daily choices, and watching those same capabilities matter when the stakes escalate.

The core loop at every level reinforces one thing: Meghan is one person. The skills she builds waiting tables on a Friday night are the skills she uses breaking into a corporate server or subduing a bounty. There is no mode switch. There is no second character. The Razor holds from minute one to the end.

## Micro Loop — Moment to Moment

The fundamental exchange is **Action → possible Reaction → Resolution**. Every action — traversal, combat, conversation, hacking, delivering a package — costs time and draws from a resource pool. The same system governs a bar fight and a customer complaint.

Moment-to-moment play moves between:

- **Traversal** — moving through the city on foot or vehicle; Parkour, Running, Driving
- **Work** — job minigames; each job trains a distinct skill cluster
- **Study** — advances the clock; trains INT/WIS skills; required for exam progression
- **Social** — conversations with the cast; relationship building; story content
- **Combat** — see [Combat](../mechanics/combat.md) for full resolution detail
- **Rest** — sleep to recover CP; the primary limiting factor on sustained activity

The unified action system means no mechanical distinction between these modes. A conversation at Burton's Bar uses the same Charisma/Wisdom resolution as a negotiation mid-bounty. Parkour through a gang hideout uses the same AGI skill as the waitress avoiding a tray collision.

## Mid Loop — The Session Structure

### The 24-Hour Clock

The game runs on a real-time 24-hour clock. Time advances proportionally to actions taken:

- Study for 1 hour → 1 hour passes on the clock
- A delivery route across the city → however long it takes
- Sleep → time passes at an accelerated rate until CP is recovered

There are no discrete action slots. The player chooses what to do and time moves accordingly. Efficient players stretch days further; players who wander or repeat failed attempts burn time.

### CP and Rest

CP (Consciousness Pool) drains naturally over the course of a day through activity and stress. When CP hits zero, Meghan is out for **6 hours** — the body forces the rest she didn't take voluntarily. This is not a game over; it is expensive lost time.

Sleep is the primary CP recovery mechanism. Meghan does not need to sleep on a fixed schedule — she needs CP to function. The system does not nag her to go to bed; it simply makes the cost of ignoring rest visible over time.

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| CP above threshold | Full capability |
| CP degraded | Reduced effectiveness; some actions harder |
| CP at zero | Forced 6-hour downtime; time lost |
| After sleep | CP restored; ready for a full day |

The Meditation skill (WIS) provides partial CP recovery between encounters — a top-up that can extend a day without a full sleep — but sleep remains the only source of full recovery.

### The Economy

Meghan's expenses are ongoing and non-negotiable:

| Expense | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Rent | Monthly |
| Food | Daily |
| Tuition | Per term |
| Textbooks and course materials | Per term |
| Clothing | Ongoing — see below |
| Smartphone repayments (to Terry) | Monthly, with interest |
| Debt repayments (to Terry, via bounty hunting) | As earned |

**Clothing** is a recurring cost driven by the clothing destruction system. Combat damages and destroys garments; in Spicy content, destruction is more frequent and has economic consequences. Meghan cannot ignore her wardrobe — a destroyed outfit is a replacement cost.

**The debt to Terry** separates bounty hunting income from ordinary living expenses. Side jobs (bar, courier, mechanic) cover rent and food. The debt requires bounty hunting income on top of that. This creates a natural financial tier: ordinary jobs sustain her; bounty hunting advances her.

---

## The Five Jobs

Meghan has five income sources available before Chapter 3, when a more stable employment situation becomes available. Each job trains a distinct skill cluster and carries its own reputation track.

### 1. Waitress at Burton's Bar

**Schedule:** Mon–Fri 5–9pm · Friday extended to 11pm · Saturday 10am–2am · Closed Sunday

The only job with fixed, time-gated availability. Burton's Bar is the lowest-variance income source — reliable but limited by operating hours and the bar's capacity.

**Primary skills:** Small Talk, Conflict Resolution, Situational Awareness, Parkour (navigating crowded service floor, carrying items)

**What it trains:** The social toolkit. Small Talk and Conflict Resolution levelled here transfer directly to negotiation in every other job and to story interactions.

**Challenges:** Disruptive patrons, tray navigation, memory-based order management. Stamina (SP) is the primary resource drain during a shift.

---

### 2. Courier / Delivery Person

**Schedule:** On demand via the delivery app (Terry finances Meghan's first smartphone — monthly repayment, with interest)

**Progression:** On foot → Bike → Motorbike → Hoverbike. Vehicle upgrades increase carrying capacity, delivery range, and city access.

**Primary skills:** Running, Driving, Parkour, Perception, Negotiation (tipping, checkpoint bypass), Hacking (electronic gate bypass)

**What it trains:** Traversal capability and city knowledge. A player who couriers extensively knows the city's geography before they need it for anything more dangerous.

**Challenges:** Package integrity, traffic, time pressure, access restrictions (solved through Negotiation or Hacking). Vehicle damage requires repair — feeding into the Mechanic job relationship.

**Unlock:** Available immediately via NPC dispatcher. The delivery app, financed by Terry, expands access to the gig economy.

---

### 3. Mechanic

**Schedule:** On demand at the repair shop

**Primary skills:** Engineering, Repair, Perception (diagnosis), Negotiation (pricing), Hacking (DRM bypass for unauthorised modifications)

**What it trains:** Engineering and Repair skills with direct application to Meghan's own vehicle maintenance and equipment upkeep. Hacking levelled here applies to every other hacking context.

**Clients:** Legitimate customers, gangs, corporations — each category carries different faction reputation implications and different risk levels.

**Challenges:** Limited tools early-game (toolkit required); shady clients create moral choices with faction consequences; tight deadlines on emergency repairs.

**Unlock:** Organic introduction via a delivery job to a repair shop. Trial repair required to demonstrate aptitude.

---

### 4. Hacker

**Schedule:** On demand via activist contacts or anonymous digital channels

**Primary skills:** Hacking, Perception, Stealth, Negotiation

**What it trains:** The intelligence toolkit under real pressure. Hacking levelled here is the same Hacking used in bounty missions, mechanic DRM bypass, and courier checkpoint access — every application benefits.

**Clients:** Two competing sources — activist groups (lower pay, information/connection bonuses) and authorities/corporations (higher pay, morally murky). Working both degrades trust with each.

**Challenges:** Logic puzzle minigame; physical traversal to terminals (rooftops, construction sites); failure consequences that persist — device lockouts, police flags, restricted digital access.

**Unlock:** 5 electronic locks hacked without detection → contacted via delivery app or anonymous burner phone.

---

### 5. Bounty Hunter

**Schedule:** On demand via law enforcement, corporate, or civilian contracts

**Primary skills:** Melee Combat, Ranged Weaponry, Stealth, Negotiation, Binding, Hacking

**What it trains:** The full combat and infiltration toolkit. The highest-risk, highest-reward job and the primary vehicle for paying down the debt to Terry.

**Clients:** Police (volume-based, legitimate), corporations (specialist contracts — Mautorium: stealth, JMC: strength, Hitsunami: tactical), gang leaders (rival elimination), civilians (stolen goods recovery). Faction balance across clients creates the same reputation tension as hacking.

**Challenges:** CP and SP depletion from combat; failure feeds into the **pipeline** (see below); faction reputation damage from client conflicts.

**Unlock:** Two routes — official (10 courier + 3 hacking jobs + 5 combat encounters, then approached by a contact) or freeform (organic city reputation through unsolicited gang interventions).

---

### Job Reputation

Each job tracks reputation independently. Reputation increases through successful completion and decreases through failure, misconduct, or client conflicts. Higher reputation unlocks:

- Better-paying contracts and clients
- Access to equipment and rare materials
- Story events and NPC connections
- Corporate or faction relationship access

**Faction tension:** The hacker, mechanic, and bounty hunter jobs all involve clients whose interests conflict. Working for activist groups degrades corporate trust; working for one corporate client may alienate rivals; working for gang leaders affects law enforcement relationships. The player manages a reputation portfolio, not a single track.

## The School Calendar — Primary Structural Pressure

The MCI entrance examination is Meghan's central objective for the first portion of the game. She has **4 months** from arrival to pass. This is the soft time pressure that structures Chapters 1 and 2 without hard-gating most content.

| Milestone | Consequence of failure |
|-----------|----------------------|
| MCI entrance exam | **Game over** — Meghan cannot enrol; her reason for being on Terridyn collapses |
| Ongoing academic performance | **Game over** — poor marks result in expulsion |
| Scheduled exam events | Marks tested at intervals; studying between events determines outcomes |

**Studying** costs time (advances the clock by the study duration) and trains INT/WIS skills. The Studying skill reduces time cost at higher levels. Failing to study while enrolled degrades marks; a sufficiently low mark at an exam event triggers expulsion.

The school calendar creates a secondary rhythm alongside the economic pressure: Meghan cannot spend all her time working, because marks will slip; she cannot spend all her time studying, because rent is due.

---

## The Failure Pipeline

When Meghan fails a bounty hunting or hacking subjob, she does not receive a game over screen. She enters the **black market holding pipeline** — the city's trafficking infrastructure — and must escape using the tools available at her current capability level.

| Game stage | Escape route |
|------------|-------------|
| Pre-Ava (early game) | Lockpicking, stealth, mundane skills only |
| Post-Ava restoration | Magical abilities available; rescue by the team possible |
| Late game | Higher security escalation; Terry may purchase Meghan from auction (generating debt) |

The pipeline is failure content, not a dead end. Each stage has its own escape mechanics. Terry purchasing Meghan at auction is commercially valid — the debt is real, the rescue is deniable, and Meghan may not know it was arranged.

---

## Macro Loop — The Game Arc

The macro loop is story chapter progression:

| Phase | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| Prologue — Chapter 2 | Economy + school calendar; build capability; assemble relationships |
| Chapter 3 | Stable income unlocked; team begins forming; stakes escalate from gang to corporate |
| Chapters 4–5 | Full team operational; CAMERA system active; institutional conflict |
| Chapter 6 | Climax; civilian skills become primary tools; everything built pays off |

**Chapter 3 — Machina Dynamics Internship:** At the end of Chapter 2, Meghan is required to apply for an internship at Machina Dynamics as the price of Tierney's assistance. The internship becomes available in Chapter 3 and provides stable, recurring income that shifts the economic pressure — survival becomes less urgent, freeing time budget for other priorities. The cost is operating inside a corporation that turns out to have its own agenda.

**Content-gated jobs:** Additional job opportunities become available in Spicy and Super Spicy content tiers as Meghan's character develops and she becomes more open with herself. These unlock through relationship progression and character growth rather than skill thresholds. See private design documentation for full detail.

---

Chapters are **task-complete, not timer-complete** — they continue until story objectives are finished. Some quests within chapters are time-limited (Celeste's auction window in Chapter 1 is the first example). The chapter itself does not expire, but specific opportunities within it do.

Skill progression across the macro loop shapes what Meghan is capable of by the end. A player who spent Chapters 1 and 2 focused on social jobs arrives at Chapter 6's guerrilla arc with strong Negotiation and Situational Awareness. A combat-focused player arrives with a different toolkit. The unified system means no choice is wasted — everything built as Meghan transfers directly to Ava.

---

## Game Over Conditions

| Condition | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Fail MCI entrance exam | Exam event reached without sufficient academic preparation |
| Expelled from MCI | Marks below threshold at a scheduled exam event |
| *(Specific mission failures)* | Documented per mission in chapter briefs where applicable |

The pipeline failure system means most job failures are not game over — they are expensive redirects. Game over is reserved for irreversible structural failures (no school = no reason to be here) and specific mission outcomes documented in chapter design.
