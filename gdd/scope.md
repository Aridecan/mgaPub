# MGA — Scope

*What is in Game 1, what is not, and what is still being decided.*

---

## What Game 1 Is

Game 1 is the complete story of Meghan on Terridyn — from her arrival through the Chapter 6 climax, the epilogue, and the structured post-game content (NG+ and NG++). It is a standalone, complete experience. Nothing essential to the story is held back for a sequel.

MGA2 is planned and the world is designed with it in mind, but Game 1 does not require it.

---

## Story Scope

| Content | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Prologue | In scope |
| Chapters 1–6 | In scope |
| Epilogue | In scope |
| New Game Plus (NG+) | In scope |
| New Game Plus Plus (NG++) | In scope |
| Chapter 7 and beyond | **Out of scope — MGA2** |

---

## System Scope

All core systems are in scope for Game 1.

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Attribute system | In scope |
| Skill system (full roster) | In scope |
| Combat | In scope |
| Resource pools (HP, CP, SP, Mana, Fuel) | In scope |
| 24-hour clock | In scope |
| Economy and expenses | In scope |
| Five jobs + MD internship (Chapter 3) | In scope |
| School calendar and MCI examination | In scope |
| Failure pipeline | In scope |
| Relationship system | In scope |
| Inhibition mechanic | In scope |
| Elemental magic | In scope |
| Magical girl transformation | In scope |
| Wand system | In scope |
| Faction reputation | In scope |
| CAMERA system (Chapter 4+) | In scope |
| Clothing and equipment | In scope — Base tier functionality; Spicy tier destruction mechanics per content tier |
| Content tiers (Base / Spicy / Super Spicy) | In scope |

---

## Content Tier Scope

### Base and Spicy

Fully scoped for Game 1. All story content, all core systems, and the Spicy-tier additions (clothing destruction, associated mechanics) are confirmed.

### Super Spicy

The explicit content layer is in scope for Game 1. Additional Super Spicy locations — adult establishments, specialised stores, casinos, and similar — are planned but scoped for development iteration rather than confirmed. These are world-expansion content that will be designed, assessed, and added progressively during production. They do not affect the story scope.

---

## Platform Scope

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Windows | Confirmed — primary |
| Linux | Confirmed — native build, secondary |
| Mac | Aspirational — target is a recompile/build on Mac via Unreal Engine's native Mac support, with no outside libraries creating platform dependencies. Not guaranteed; confirmed if the build is clean. |
| Steam Deck | Test platform — evaluated if hardware is available during development; not a confirmed launch target |
| Console | Out of scope |

---

## Mod Tools Scope

The manifesto commits to mod-friendly infrastructure. The specific scope at launch:

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| Mod loader | In scope |
| Dependency checking | In scope |
| Boot stream for mods | In scope — mods load at game start or save load, not at main menu; see [Manifesto — Boot Lifecycle](manifesto.md#10-the-boot-lifecycle-is-supported) |
| Full mod support (documentation, mod SDK, developer support) | Out of scope — the infrastructure is provided; mod community support beyond that is not |

---

## Demo Scope (Planned)

The public demo will include:

- Narrative progression through the end of Chapter 1
- Three representative side jobs

The demo is intended as a long-term systems validation environment — showcasing core combat, player agency tools, and the foundational gameplay loop without exposing late-game mechanics or narrative escalations. Demo scope is fixed at Chapter 1 and does not expand.

The demo will be distributed on **itch.io** initially. Steam demo release is planned for later, once the visual style and systems are more mature. itch.io is chosen for its technical audience, devlog-heavy communication model, and controlled expectations.

---

## Early Access Scope (Planned)

Early Access begins once all core systems (combat architecture, save infrastructure, feature tiering, input systems, UI frameworks) are considered structurally complete — currently projected around the start of Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 development.

**EA content boundary:** Playable through Chapter 6, concluding just before the ascent to the anchor station via the space elevator. The final battles, the Tierney reveal, the ending tragedy, the epilogue, and New Game+ modes are reserved for full release.

**EA philosophy:** During Early Access, development focus shifts from feature expansion to stabilization, balance refinement, performance optimization, and content iteration. No new foundational systems will be introduced during Early Access.

---

## Achievement Policy

Steam achievements are not disabled when mods are active. Steam does not require it for single-player games, and MGA does not police how players engage with their own game. Achievements are controlled entirely by the game calling the Steamworks API — there is no platform-enforced "clean environment" check.

---

## Tentative

Items that are planned and may ship with Game 1, but are subject to cut if scope pressure requires it.

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Sports tournament (Chapter 4) | Planned as part of the Ava–Nagi cooperation arc; cuttable if development timeline requires it |

---

## Out of Scope — Game 1

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Chapters 7–8 | MGA2 |
| Hell as a major playable setting | MGA2 |
| Fox demon arc | MGA2 |
| Ark ships / first contact | MGA2 endgame |
| Console platforms | Not planned for initial release |
| Full human voice cast at launch | Post-launch if budget allows; AI VO ships with Game 1 |
| Mod SDK / full mod documentation | Community infrastructure; not developer-supported |

---

## Open Items

- Final Super Spicy location list — to be iterated during development
- Mac build confirmation — determined when a Mac build is attempted
- Steam Deck compatibility result — determined during testing if hardware is available
- Sports tournament — confirmed or cut during Chapter 4 production
